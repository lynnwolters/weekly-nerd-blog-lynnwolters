                    <p class="text-light-dark-blue paragraph">On February 7, 2024, Kilian Valkhof, a seasoned web developer with 20 years of experience, talked about the changes in web development and his creation of the Polypane browser. His approach is pretty different: he suggests using less JavaScript and relying more on HTML and CSS for responsive design and accessibility testing.
                    <br><br>
                    Valkhof thinks it's better to pick the simplest language that can do the job, rather than always going for JavaScript. He says many developers try to do things that could be done with just HTML and CSS. Doing this not only gets you the accessibility features of HTML but also means you don't need as many extra packages, which makes your website work better.
                    <br><br>
                    Even though you technically don't have to keep learning new stuff once you know something, Valkhof says it's important to keep learning and growing. He tells developers to be open to learning new things, even if they're already pretty good at what they do.
                    <br><br>
                    He suggests using custom elements like toggles and checkboxes in HTML and changing their styles with CSS to make them look unique. He also talks about using datalists for suggestions while typing, which makes things easier for users, and using CSS properties like scroll-behaviour to make scrolling smoother without needing lots of JavaScript.
                    <br><br>
                    Other cool CSS tricks Valkhof talks about include scroll-snap for carousels and using accordions to organize content by expanding and collapsing sections. He also mentions container queries, which let you design based on the size of individual containers instead of just the screen size.
                    <br><br>
                    Overall, Valkhof's way of doing web development gives a new perspective on how powerful HTML and CSS can be, leading to websites that are more accessible, efficient, and optimized.
